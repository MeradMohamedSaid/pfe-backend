# Life Flow Backend: Express.js Endpoints

The backend of Life Flow utilizes Express.js to provide a robust and efficient API for managing blood-related operations. Leveraging the power of Node.js, Express.js offers a scalable and flexible platform for building RESTful APIs, allowing seamless communication between the frontend and the database.

## Features

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Define clear and intuitive endpoints for performing CRUD operations on blood-related entities such as donors, donations, and blood requests.
- **Middleware**: Implement middleware functions to handle authentication, input validation, and error handling, ensuring the security and reliability of the API.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate with a database (MySQL) to store and retrieve data related to blood donors, donations, and inventory management.
- **Scalability**: Design endpoints in a modular and scalable manner to accommodate future enhancements and additional features.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
2. **Configuration**: Set up environment variables for database connection and other configuration options.
3. **Run Server**: Start the Express.js server using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
